KOS Terms Template 

The licences below allow member firms to share software or the like for free on an “as is” unrestricted basis.  The sharing firm incurs no liability to the receiving firm.  The receiving firm is entirely responsible for ensuring that what it has received is fit for purpose and, if it lets others use the software (which is a decision for the receiving firm’s Risk function), for agreeing suitable terms with those users.
There are two versions of this licence.  
•	Type 1 is used where the use of the licenced material is internal to the KPMG network, or a subset of it, such as specific other firms.  Please note the 4th paragraph is an optional clause that requires derivative works to also be made available to the Permitted Recipients or to the licensing member firm.  This is not obligatory, but provides wording if required.    
•	Type 2 is used where the owning firm is happy for the recipient firm to provide the licensed materials to a wider audience such as clients.
Please make sure that you have included an adequate description of the material to be licensed.
